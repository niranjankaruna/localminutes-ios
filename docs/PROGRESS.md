# Progress log

## Initial state — 23 October 2026
Specification package prepared. No repository, app code, build, installation, or device verification has been performed. Next task: T00.

## Append an entry after each work slice
Include date/time, task/requirement IDs, actual changes, RED test/commit/run, GREEN test/commit/run, regressions, artifact if any, limitations, blockers, and next task. Never replace actual results with planned results. Keep sensitive data out.

## 23 October 2026, 15:42–15:45 Europe/Dublin — T00 and T01 complete

Created and verified private `niranjankaruna/localminutes-ios`. Initial specification
commit `5767409b9bc8797a53409bc4bd86799019c833b4` is pushed on main; remote HEAD
matched local HEAD. The initial 19 files passed staged whitespace and sensitive
content review, including an independent read-only bootstrap review. Evidence:
`docs/evidence/T00_BOOTSTRAP.md`.

T01 account observations verified included Actions minutes and an existing $0
account-wide Actions hard budget through signed-in browser settings. No billing
change or CI dispatch occurred. Artifact storage displays its included limit;
test logs can proceed without artifact uploads. Selected documented standard
`macos-15-intel` with Xcode 26.2 / 17C52 and pinned checkout v7.0.1 commit;
actual hosted environment remains to be logged by T02.
Evidence: `docs/evidence/T01_ENVIRONMENT.md`.

RED/GREEN/product tests: NOT_RUN (documentation/account-only work). No IPA or
device evidence exists; every device gate remains NOT_RUN. Next: run genuine
T02 harness RED/GREEN on hosted macOS. New CI runs so far: 0 of 6.
